                <h6>ABOUT OUR OWNERS</h6>
                <h3>Meet Michelle and Joe.</h3>
                <p>Over 20 years ago,newly married coldwater, Ohio natives, Michelle and Joe McClurg,began dreaming of how they would create the perfect coffee shop.With their combined love of quality coffee and espresso, and a healthy, invigorating meal(Joe and Michelle help her father on an organic dairy farm and Michelle is a registered dietitian/foodie),they imagined a simplified menu that would perfectly compliment a hot(or iced) cup of something special. Fast forward to 2019, and Rooster Joe is here.While they're committed to being on-trend, Michelle and Joe value friendliness, simplicity, quality and speed over everything else-- something fresh and tasty, made in record time, in a welcoming space that feels like home. You'll find them behind the counter. They want to meet you,get to know you,and serve you again and again. </p>
